The purpose of this assignment\footnote{This document is originally 
based on a blog from Cleve Moler, who wrote a fantastic blog post about the Lake Arrowhead graph, and John 
Gilbert, who initially created the coauthor graph from the 1993 Householder Meeting. You can find more information 
at \url{http://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2013/06/10/lake-arrowhead-coauthor-graph/}.  Most of this assignment is derived
from this archived work.} is to learn the importance of sparse linear algebra algorithms to solve fundamental 
questions in social network analyses.
We will use the coauthor graph from the Householder Meeting and the social network of friendships from Zachary's karate club~\cite{karate}.
These two graphs are one of the first examples where matrix methods were used in computational social network analyses.
